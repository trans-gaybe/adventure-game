        <p>You decide to brush Silver's fur.</p>
        <p>Grabbing the brush from your desk, Silver immediately gets up and meows at you. She's always liked being brushed.</p>
        <p>Gently, you run the brush through her sides first, then across her back. You can hear Silver purring.</p>
        <p>She lies down and rolls over, her belly exposed. You carefully brush her chest and the top of her stomach. You know she doesn't like having her stomach touched, even by you.</p>
     
        <p>You remember that Silver's bowl is still <a href="page3.html">empty</a>. Maybe you should go fill it up.</p>
