--------------------

this game is about you playing as the main charecter in the game.
but the this game is basiclly telling you that you have to stay awake during the game, but if you go to sleep in the game, you would fail the game. but then you would have to restart the game over and over, if you don't choose the right choises. and that's it!, thanks for lissening!
