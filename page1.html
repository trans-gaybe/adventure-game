=======
                
                <p>You decide to gently pet Silver. She wakes up and stretches back and paws, yawning in the process.</p>
                
                <p>Once she notices that your hand is there, she curls up around your hand. She seems to want to go back to sleep.</p>
                
                <p>You notice her fur is a little ragged. You should probably <a href="page2.html">brush</a> her fur.</p>
                
                <p>You remember her bowl is still empty. It isn't going to <a href="page3.html">fill up</a> by itself.</p>
